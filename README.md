New to GitHub, who dis?

Hi everyone,
I'm Alper. I've been working in the digital marketing field for more than 10 years. Now, I am curious to learn more about coding and data mining to see how I can grow in my career.
I'm also a big fan of heavy metal, play electric guitar, and have a website where I do articles on albums and bands.
Thanks for reading!
